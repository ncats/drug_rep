Covariates:
- BMI (within 2 months before and 1 month after cancer diagnosis date)
	- restricted cubic spline functions with four knots
- non-cancer Charlson index (before or within 30 days after the date of cancer diagnosis)
	- restricted cubic spline functions with four knots
- tumor location (first incident tumor only) (i.e. lobes or multiple or other)
- tumor resection degree: gross total resection (GTR) vs other surgery (incl. subtotal/partial resection)
- yes radiotherapy?
- diagnosis period (pre-2004 vs post-2004)

TK Can we determine these:
- epilepsy
- recurrent resection



Imputation:
- shouldn't we impute when we have all Subjects which have GBM diagnosis?





Figures:
- Consort diagrams
- characteristic tables


Code:
- add 'validate' parameter to pandas functions



- what is the radiotherapy called? (e.g. ICD). i can't seem to find it in Procedures of Dx data
- since i can see "ventricular" stuff can i see "subventricular" stuff and include that as covariate? maybe the keywords are the hyponyms of subventricular procedures (i.e. search those up!)



- put all imputation (and nullity-encoding) into final (i.e. surv_analysis.py) code
