------------------------------Chi-square test results for Gender------------------------------
Observed frequencies table:
Gender  GBM_counts
Female         434
  Male         717
Chi-squared statistic:	[81.38436515]
p-value:	1.858e-19
Expected frequencies table:
Gender  genpop_counts
  Male            564
Female            587
Are all expected frequencies greater than 5?	True
There is a significant association between being recorded as having GBM and being male or female.


------------------------------Chi-square test results for Race------------------------------
Observed frequencies table:
                Race  GBM_counts
               Asian          36
  Black/African Amer          76

Chi-squared statistic:	[326.15249747]
p-value:	2.023e-67
Expected frequencies table:
                Race  genpop_counts
               White            709
  Black/African Amer            143
Am Indian/Alaska Nat             13
               Asian             69
Hawaiian/Pac. Island              2
                 NaN             97
       Multiple Race            118
Are all expected frequencies greater than 5?	False
There is a significant association between being recorded as having GBM and being of a certain race.
Due to one expected count being less than 5, bear in mind that the null hypothesis could have been falsely rejected in this case.

------------------------------Chi-square test results for Ethnicity------------------------------
Observed frequencies table:
             Ethnicity  GBM_counts
    Hispanic or Latino          31
Not Hispanic or Latino        1103
                   NaN          17
Chi-squared statistic:	[766.25310346]
p-value:	4.076e-167

             Ethnicity  genpop_counts
    Hispanic or Latino            216
Not Hispanic or Latino            935
                   NaN              0
Are all expected frequencies greater than 5?	False
There is a significant association between being recorded as having GBM and being Hispanic/Latino or not.
Due to one expected count being less than 5, bear in mind that the null hypothesis could have been falsely rejected in this case.
